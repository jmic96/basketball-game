# Unity Basketball RPG/Simulator

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and assets for a **basketball role‑playing and management game** built with Unity 5 and C#. The game blends **sports simulation**, **character progression**, and **management/building** elements.  Players start as a young athlete in a local league and progress through high school, college, semi‑pro and eventually professional basketball.  Games are simulated based on player and team statistics, with occasional interactive moments where players can influence key plays.

Key features planned:

* **Progression system** – Train your character to improve skills (shooting, passing, defense, mental) and advance through multiple leagues.
* **Resource management** – Spend limited energy and in‑game currency on training, rest, equipment and facility upgrades.
* **Building and management** – Upgrade gyms, training facilities and eventually manage an entire team when you reach the professional level.
* **Story events and relationships** – Unlock narrative arcs and relationships that impact morale, fame and skills.
* **Simulated matches** – Most games run automatically based on stats, but interactive “pop‑ins” allow direct input on clutch plays.

## Directory structure

The project follows a standard Unity layout with a few custom folders for organization (see Unity’s folder structure best practices【758977255047357†L281-L305】):

```

Unity generates `.meta` files for every asset; these should be committed to version control so that import settings are preserved【758977255047357†L374-L385】.

## Getting started

1. **Clone the repository** (after it’s been pushed to GitHub).  Use Unity Hub to open the project folder.
2. **Install dependencies** – The project targets Unity 5; ensure you have the appropriate Unity version installed.
3. **Run the game** – Open the primary scene in `Assets/Scenes/` and click the Play button.

Feel free to contribute by opening issues or submitting pull requests as the project evolves.
